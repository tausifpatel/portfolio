One fine morning, I walked into the tattoo studio where met Tyler and Sean, and had a brief chat if they are interested to have a slick and modern website. Sean showed the interest, and rest is the history.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"case01__text\">\n                Jumping on this opportunity paid off not only in terms of gained experience but reminded me as well about one of my core values — to help and support creatives I believe in.\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"case01__title-small\">\n                Role\n            </h3>\n            <p className=\"case01__text\">\n                Web Design, UI/UX, Front-End Development \n            </p>\n            <h1 className=\"case01__title-small\">\n                What's SteelBeauty?\n            </h1>\n            <p className=\"case01__text\">\n                Established in December of 1999 Steel Beauty was one of the first Tattoo and Piercing studios in Redbridge. With Sean Lowery at the helm as owner and head tattooist, Steel Beauty has earned its place as one of the most reputable studios in Essex.\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"case01__title-medium\">\n                Design\n            </h3>\n            <p className=\"case01__text\">\n                My plan was to extend the existing idea of the brand (i.e. colour scheme and typography) and build a more sophisticated style for the new website, but there was pretty much nothing to go on other than a logo designed by Tyler. \n            </p>\n            <p className=\"case01__text\">\n                So I observed the interior of their studio, it has a great combination of retro and modern styles with some dark walls and golden colour elements on them. Taking that into consideration I decided that the website theme is going to be dark with gold elements. Sean suggested to include texture from the studio’s wall somehow. It was quite challenging, after bit of a brainstorming I found a good place to stick the texture - serving sides of content.\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"case01__margin\"></div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container-wide\">\n            <div className=\"case01__coltext\">\n                <h3 className=\"case01__title-small\">\n                    colours & texture\n                </h3>\n                <div className=\"case01__coltextbox\">\n                    <div>\n                        <div className=\"block gold\"></div>\n                        <h3 className=\"case01__title-small\">Gold #e1c173</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <div className=\"block blue\"></div>\n                        <h3 className=\"case01__title-small\">Blue #16171b</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <div className=\"block texture\"></div>\n                        <h3 className=\"case01__title-small\">Studio wallpaper</h3>\n                    </div>   \n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"case01__typography\">\n                <h3 className=\"case01__title-small\">\n                    Typography\n                </h3>\n                <h1 className=\"case01__typography-large\">\n                    Aa\n                </h1>\n                <h1 className=\"case01__typography-small\">\n                    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z <br/>\n                    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz <br/>\n                    0123456789 (.,:;?!@£$%^&*-=)\n                </h1>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n            <h3 className=\"case01__title-medium\">\n                User experience\n            </h3>\n            <p className=\"case01__text\">\n                I browsed through various sources for inspirations and analysed Tattoo websites to get some idea about the content, layout and any small detail I can include. \n            </p>\n            <p className=\"case01__text\">\n                A research and analysis led me to have specific features of the website\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"case01__title-small\">\n                Feature\n            </h3>\n            <p className=\"case01__text\">\n                a small section featuring their best work, with a link view more that leads you to the gallery section if a client is interested to explore more awesome work by Sean and Tyler.\n            </p>\n            <img className=\"ux-image\" src={require('../images/gif/features.gif')} alt=\"\" className=\"ux-image\"/>\n            <h3 className=\"case01__title-small\">\n                About us\n            </h3>\n            <p className=\"case01__text\">\n                Once you are mesmerised with the great work from both artists, it’s interesting to know the story behind the studio and more about individual artists (since you will be curious to know about someone who is going to put ink in your skin).
