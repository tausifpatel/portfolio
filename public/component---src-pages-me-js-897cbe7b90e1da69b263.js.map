I discovered, a new, more efficient and more adaptable side of me. In a very short period of time I managed to achieve a position to take projects on hand as a freelancer, leading me to explore the market and master the skills of web development.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"me__textbox-text\">\n                        As a web developer, I put my best self forward.
